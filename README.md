# Kaggle-Projects
A simple repository linking to my past and current Kaggle projects 

# Classification and Localization of brain hemorrahges in CT brain images 
This project was part of my bachelor thesis. Different version include different variations of the model

The best performing version is version 18; computes using the Specificity at Sensitivity metric


# Distaster Tweet Classification 
This project was part of the Natural Langauge Processing Class. Use different pre-trained language model: Bert, DistillBert and RoBerta

Include some testing on newly created data at the end 

# Object Detection in Lung CT images for COVID-19 diagnosis
This project was completed to play around with data collection and vizualation, and introduce myself to object detection using the YoloV5 framework

Most of the code was taken from other notebooks, and slightly modified to explore how it works 

# Ventilator Pressure Prediction 
Project Recently started, the goal being to practice with Pytorch
